# project-GoCheeta


“GoCheeta” is a well reputed cab service located in Sri Lanka Island wide. It has several branches
like Galle, Kandy, Nugegoda, Gampaha, Kurunegala and Jaffna). It has been delivering its
services in the mode of a mobile app, and now they want to implement it as in a website either due
to the requirement identified at several points.
The customers can get registered first to the system. Then a registered customer can order any type
of vehicle available via the website. But once the booking is made, both the pick-up and
destination locations will be restricted only within one exact city, that they choose out of the
given list(predefined as per only where branches are located in).
There are registered drivers in the system where the customer cannot pick one but depending on
the availability of vehicles, the driver associated will be selected and be informed by the system
itself.

Customer
Customers can register to the system themselves, search for a respective category of vehicle (you
can assume the types of vehicles by your own) in the system. Once they search for a vehicle, the
available list of vehicles will be prompted and out of that they can pick up any vehicle available
in. They have to choose the source and destination as per in two drop down fields as Street address
and city. They can also view the price for the journey depending on a distance-price scenario which
is free to be assumed by you (developer/student). But this price-distance scenario should be
reflected and transparent enough in both your documentation and coding. They can view the all
the bookings they have made so far along with the details and can leave a feedback once the
journey is completed about their entire experience on the tour.

Admin
Admin can add new drivers, vehicles and categories of vehicles to the systems plus having them
update, remove and view the details, view all the customer bookings (along with customer details,
vehicle and driver details associated with the booking) of all the branches, and view the total sales
made by each branch and the total of all the branches at any given time.
Booking of vehicles
Once a particular booking is accepted by the driver, it should be updated with the status of journey
(booking) to the customer including pick up and when dropping by.
Drivers
Drivers are all registered in a specific branch and associated with a specific set of vehicles already.
Vehicles
Vehicles are associated exactly with any identified category and it should be registered under a
specific branch and should be associated with specific set/ one exact driver
Note:
 Admins of the system are the officials, specifically appointed by the main branch.
 The payments for the customer orders can only be made as cash on delivery.
 Once a booking is made, there is no way of cancelling it through the system(any alternative
way can be provided like sharing the phone number of drivers through the system and
